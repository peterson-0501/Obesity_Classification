# Obesity Classification

This project was developed as part of our Machine Learning course.

The objective was to classify obesity levels using a given dataset. Multiple machine learning models were implemented and compared to determine the most effective one for accurately representing the data and making reliable predictions.

Data was taken from the Kaggle.
